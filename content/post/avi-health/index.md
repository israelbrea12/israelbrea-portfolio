This project was developed during the course of Information Technology and Services Management (ITSM) during my fourth year of college. The main objective of the project was to develop an Android mobile application that would cover the telecare need of an integrated care process (ICP) modeled by the Andalusian Health Service (SAS). Specifically, this application focuses on the dermatological telecare process of patients with skin cancer.

## Project description:
This project involves the development of an Android application to streamline the management of the Integrated Care Process (ICP) of skin cancer, using Firebase for real-time data management. The application facilitates instant communication between the patient and the dermatologist, improving the efficiency of the treatment.

## What is AVI Health?
AVI Health is an application that allows patients to make dermatological consultations, schedule appointments, and manage teleconsultations with their doctors from an accessible and easy-to-use platform. In turn, doctors can manage consultations and respond to requests in real time, providing more efficient and closer care to the patient. In addition, this application provides an environment that allows the patient to share images of their progress with the dermatologist, who can respond and follow up almost immediately, reducing the usual waiting times. All this is achieved by integrating Firebase as a backend platform for data storage and user management, which ensures the scalability of the system and protection against losses.

In addition, the application includes other key functionalities such as access to the location of nearby medical centers on Google Maps, management of profiles for both doctors and patients...

## Why was it created?
The main objective of this application is to improve patient care and decision-making during the skin cancer treatment process. This type of cancer affects thousands of people, and waiting times for consultations and diagnoses can negatively affect treatment. This tool aims to streamline communication between doctors and patients, providing a platform that allows for instant consultations and teleconsultations, which is key in the era of e-Health.
