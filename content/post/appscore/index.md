SCORECARD TPNi CG ​​is a native mobile application designed and developed to **identify high-risk patients** in abdominal and colorectal surgery, facilitating the application of single-use negative pressure therapy when appropriate. Based on clinical evidence, this tool optimizes the prevention of complications at the surgical site, improving recovery and reducing costs for the health system. This project was carried out for the company **FOINCO Formación Investigación Coloproctología** and in collaboration with **Smith & Nephew**, and has been endorsed by entities such as the Spanish Group for Multimodal Rehabilitation (GERM), the Spanish Association of Coloproctology (AECP) and the Observatory of Infection in Surgery.

## What is SCORECARD TPNi CG?
The main objective of the application is to help health professionals identify whether a surgical patient has a high risk of complications, based on factors such as:
- **Patient factors**: advanced age, immunosuppression, etc.
- **Surgical factors**: prolonged surgical time, iterative surgeries, among others.

Risk scenarios are determined using the CSQ Consensus Table, providing a clear recommendation:
- **Patients at risk**: suggestion to use single-use negative pressure therapy (NPT) for 7 days, developed by Smith & Nephew.
- **Patients not at risk**: recommendation to use a standard post-surgical dressing.

## What does the app include?
SCORECARD NPTS CG is structured in key sections that guarantee its functionality and educational value:
- **Risk calculation section**: Allows the user to enter patient and surgical procedure data to obtain the associated recommendation.
- **Mechanism of action**: Explains the benefits and rationale of the single-use negative pressure therapy system.
- **Studies and bibliography**: Gathers scientific evidence supporting the application's recommendations and functionalities.
- **Frequently asked questions**: Provides answers to common questions about the use of TPN and the prevention of SCI.

## Development and publication
This application was developed completely natively for **iOS** (using Swift and MVC architecture) and **Android** (with Kotlin and MVVM architecture). I managed all phases of the software development cycle, from initial planning to publication in the app stores:
- **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store** under the name SCORECARD TPNi CG.
- Also available on the official website of the **AECP**.

## Endorsements and Recognitions
The application has the support of key institutions in the surgical and health field:
- **Spanish Group of Multimodal Rehabilitation (GERM)**.
- **Spanish Association of Coloproctology (AECP)**.
- **Infection Observatory in Surgery**.

SCORECARD TPNi CG ​​is a tool that not only improves clinical decision making, but also strengthens evidence-based surgical practice.
