## Problem Domain

Bed management in a hospital is one of the daily tasks. of any admission service and also one of the ones that causes the most conflicts in the daily operation of the hospital. The allocation of the bed to the patient who is going to be admitted is only one part of what is called Bed Management, and affects both the patients who are going to be admitted and those already admitted, and the free beds as well as the occupied ones.

## Objectives

The requirement of an adequate control in the occupation of hospital stretchers requires an adequate management of the information, a knowledge about the different stretcher rooms, types of stretchers, their occupation, doctors in charge of each patient who will have an assigned room, etc.â€¦ Given this situation, it is proposed to create a web application where each user will have their own access.

## System users

The three users who will be able to access the system will be: - Administrator - Attendant, will only be able to view the data that corresponds to him.

- Doctor, will only be able to view the data that corresponds to him.
